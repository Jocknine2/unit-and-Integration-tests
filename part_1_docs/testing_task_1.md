### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.

# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.:
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc.

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer.

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      # 2* = required.
      return True
    else
    # no colon after else so function won't run completely.
      return False


  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  # def not dif and comma required between card1 and card2.
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
    # card has not been provided and so nothing will be returned.
  else:
    return card2
    # if statement not within the function, indentation required.



def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total

  # function outside of the class.
```
